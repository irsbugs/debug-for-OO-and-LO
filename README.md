# debug for OpenOffice and LibreOffice

If you ever used the BASIC programming language that is embedded in the OpenOffice/LibreOffice suite of applications, then you are likely to be disappointed with the builtin debugging facilities. To perform this type of debugging you enter command like:

msgbox oDoc.Dbg_Properties
msgbox oDoc.Dbg_Methods
msgbox oDoc.Dbg_SupportedInterfaces


```
sub debug(optional oObject as object)
	' Utility routine to write an objects properties, methods and supported
	' interfaces to a text file.
	' Calls the function ShellSort()
	' Tested on Ubuntu 20.04.2 and LibreOffice Version: 6.4.7.2
	' Author: Ian Stewart. Date: July 2021
	' Usage: Add debug subroutine and ShellSort function to your Basic code.
	' In your Basic code add a line to call debug. E.g. debug(oDocument)
